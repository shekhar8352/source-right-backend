# Accounts App

User identity and account-related concerns. This app will evolve to handle profile data, authentication extensions, and user lifecycle policies.

## Notes
- Currently uses Django's default user model via `AUTH_USER_MODEL`.
- If we switch to a custom user model, do it here before production data exists.
